# Aircraft Safety Analysis

-------------------------------------------

## Description

This is a project that studies aircraft accidents and incidents from the year 1948 to 2022. The reason of this project is to finish the first phase of the FlatIron Data Science bootcamp. It was required to carry out an investigation of this dataset to come up with 3 business recommendations for investments in the aircraft field. The problem needed to be solved is defined below:

*Your company is expanding in to new industries to diversify its portfolio. Specifically, they are interested in purchasing and operating airplanes for commercial and private enterprises, but do not know anything about the potential risks of aircraft. You are charged with determining which aircraft are the lowest risk for the company to start this new business endeavor. You must then translate your findings into actionable insights that the head of the new aviation division can use to help decide which aircraft to purchase.*

The steps followed in the analysis were:
- 1. Descriptive Statistics
- 2. Making a primary key
- 3. Duplicates study
- 4. Null-values analysis
- 5. Further study of the rest of the columns
- 6. Results

## Technologies

I have used **Python** with Jupyter notebook and I have also used **Tableau** to represent the business insight results.

## Project Status

The project is in a development process at this moment. 

## What to find in the repository

There is a folder called notebook that contains all the necessary analysis.

There is a requirements.txt that contains the information of the libraries used in this project.

There is a .gitignore that allows to exclude files that are of no interest.

There is a branch named feature/phase1 to work in the project and I have done a pull request to **develop**. This is the branch that contains all the updated information.
