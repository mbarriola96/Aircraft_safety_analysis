# Aircraft Safety Analysis

-------------------------------------------

## Description

This is a project that studies aircraft accidents and incidents from the year 1948 to 2022. The reason of this project is to finish the first phase of the FlatIron Data Science bootcamp. It was required to carry out an investigation of this dataset to come up with 3 business recommendations for investments in the aircraft field. The problem needed to be solved is defined below:

*Your company is expanding in to new industries to diversify its portfolio. Specifically, they are interested in purchasing and operating airplanes for commercial and private enterprises, but do not know anything about the potential risks of aircraft. You are charged with determining which aircraft are the lowest risk for the company to start this new business endeavor. You must then translate your findings into actionable insights that the head of the new aviation division can use to help decide which aircraft to purchase.*
